# Setting up variables and functions

# Temperature is increasing over time - temp at time t equals min of (tT / 100, T). It rises until T = 100 and flattens out after that. If we know t and T, you can plug in to the equation. t = years from now, T = BAU temperature increase at year 100.

# Save variables to make manipulation easier

# Year
t <- 50

# BAU temp increase at year 100
T <- 4.4

# Other paramaters
B <- 0.05
g <- 0.01
o <- 0.005
n <- 0.5

# Functions 

# Temperature in year T relative to temp at time 0

temp = function(t,T)
{
  out = min(t*T/100,T)
  return(out)
}

temp(t, T)

# Economic Activity - Activity reduces with heat over time. Fraction of economic activity retained in a year if tempt is r(t):

activity = function(B, temp)
{
  out = exp(-B*(temp^2))
  return(out)
}

activity(B, temp = temp(t, T))

# Consumption - economic activity growing over time at rate g but reduced by K. total consumption at time t is: 

consumption = function(activity, g, t)
{
  out = activity*(exp(g*t))
  return(out)
}

consumption(g, t, activity = activity(B, temp = temp(t, T))) 

# Utility - society's utility from consumption 

utility = function(consumption, n)
{
  out = ((consumption^(1-n))/(1-n))
  return(out)
}

utility(n, consumption = (consumption(g, t, activity = activity(B, temp = temp(t, T)))))

# Discount rate given by Ramsey Rule 

discount = function(o, n, g)
{
  out = o + (n*g)
  return(out)
}

discount(o, n, g)
